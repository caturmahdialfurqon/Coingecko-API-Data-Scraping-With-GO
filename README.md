# Coingecko-API-Data-Scraping-With-GO

This actually doesn't scrap data from `coingecko` but from [CryptoBubble](https://cryptobubbles.net/) Because the web uses the `CoinGecko API`. So, I got Unlimited API here, to check CryptoCurrency Data like Price, MarketCap, Supply, etc using Terminal CLI.

This Script is Written in `GOLANG` (Go Programming Language), very basic, I don't use packages like `GoColly` or `Goquery` for Web Scraping with Go, I like the primitive way. XD, because it's simple for me.

## How to use

For Mac User you can just `RUN` The Program `gecko`

```bash
./gecko
```
dont forget to change MOD with +x

```bash
chmod +x gecko
```

For anoter user like Windows or Linux just Build the Source code `gecko.go` <br>

with the following command below:

```bash
go build gecko.go
```

or just run the program wiithout `build` the app.

```bash
go run gecko.go
```
